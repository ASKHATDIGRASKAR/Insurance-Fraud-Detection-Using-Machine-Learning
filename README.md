# 🚗 Insurance Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

An AI-powered dashboard that detects fraudulent insurance claims using **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Anomaly Detection**.

This project demonstrates how data science can help insurance companies identify suspicious claims and reduce fraud losses.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Insurance fraud costs companies billions every year. Detecting fraud manually is slow and inefficient.

This project builds an **AI fraud detection system** that:

- Analyzes insurance claim data
- Predicts if a claim is fraudulent
- Detects anomalies in claim behavior
- Visualizes fraud analytics in a dashboard

The application includes a **Streamlit dashboard** where users can input claim data or upload a dataset to detect fraud automatically.

# ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- Joblib

# 🧠 Machine Learning Models

This project uses multiple AI techniques:

### Random Forest Classifier
Used for the main fraud detection model.

### Deep Learning Model
A neural network that learns patterns in claim data.

### Isolation Forest
Detects anomalies and suspicious patterns in claims.
